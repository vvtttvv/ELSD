# Introduction
Hello, this project is about domain specific languages, chemistry and a lot of pain. It was made by a small team from the Technical University of Moldova, FCIM faculty, software engineering program. We tried to make the life of school and university students a little bit better and we hope we succeeded!

# How to run project
The current security policy of most web browsers prohibits launching a modular project through a regular index.html. There are several ways to launch a project bypassing this restriction.

- The first way to run a project involves merging all js files into one (script.js) and removing all imports and default exports from it. In this case, the entire project will run in one big file.

- The second way to run a project (the one I usually used) involves running an online server. If you use vs code, you can download the extension "[LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)".  After that you can click RMB on index.html and choose "Open with Live Server"

# How to work with our project
When you open index.html you can write expression in left window. After pressing button "Run" you will see the result. For now it is an array of tokens in the right winow and a parse tree in console. To open the console you need to press next combination: ctrl+shift+j.
