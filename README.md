# Introduction
ChemOrg is a domain-specific language (DSL) interpreter designed to evaluate, analyse, and simulate chemical expressions and reactions in a structured, programmable environment. It was made by a small team from the Technical University of Moldova, FCIM faculty, software engineering program. The goal is to assist high school and university students in solving chemistry problems.

# How to run the DSL
Modern web browsers enforce strict security policies that prevent ES module-based JavaScript projects from being launched directly via `index.html` using the `file://` protocol. As a result, attempting to run a modular project locally without a server may result in import errors.
There are two approaches to run the project:
### 1. Use a Local Development Server
A more robust and maintainable solution is to run the project through a local server environment. If you're using **Visual Studio Code**, you can install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
Once installed:
- Right-click on `index.html`
- Select **"Open with Live Server"**
This will launch the project in your default browser via a local HTTP server, enabling full support for ES module imports.
### 2. Bundle All JavaScript Files into a Single Script
This method involves manually or programmatically merging all JavaScript files into a single `script.js` file. All `import` and `export` statements must be removed, and module logic should be adapted accordingly. This approach consolidates the entire project into one file, allowing it to be executed directly without a module loader.

# How to use the DSL
Upon opening `index.html`, you will be presented with an interface consisting of two main panels. You can enter expressions or code in the left panel. To execute the code, click the **"Run"** button. The output will be displayed follows in the right panel. A detailed parse tree will be printed to the browser's developer console. To view the console output, open the developer tools by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + J** .

# Syntax

### **Variable declaration (`let`)** - Declares and assigns a variable.  
`let x = "C6H6"`

### **Variable reassignment (`=`)** - Updates the value of an existing variable.  
`x = "H2O"`

### **Output display (`show`)** - Prints a value in the output panel.

Input:`show("Result")`

Output:`Result`

### **Conditional execution (`if`, `elif`, `else`)** -Executes blocks of code based on truth ondition.

Input:
```
if (possible("NaOH + HCl -> NaCl + H2O")) {
show("Valid reaction");
} else {
show("Invalid reaction");
}
```

Output:`Valid reaction`

### **String concatenation (`+`)** - Joins two strings into one.
  
Input:
```
let var = "C6H6";
show(var + " + O2 -> CO2 + H2O");
```

Output: `C6H6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O`

## Reaction possibility
Checks whether a given chemical reaction is feasible based on known compound interactions and rules.  
**Input:** `show(possible("NaOH + HCl -> NaCl + H2O"));`  
**Output:**  
`The reaction "NaOH + HCl -> NaCl + H2O" is chemically possible.`

- **âœ“ Conditions:** room temperature, aqueous  
- **ðŸ§ª Reactant information:**  
  â€¢ HCl: Strong Non-oxygenated Acid (monoprotic)  
  â€¢ NaOH: Strong Base (Soluble)

`true`

## Balance reaction
Balances a chemical reaction.  
**Input:** `show(resolve("Fe + O2 -> Fe2O3"));`  
**Output:** `"4 Fe + 3 O2 -> 2 Fe2O3"`

## Oxidizing agents
Returns known oxidizing agents found in the reaction.  
**Input:** `show(getOxidixngs("H2 + Cl2 -> HCl"));`  
**Output:** `Oxidizing Agent: Cl2`

## Reducing agents
Returns known reducing agents found in the reaction.  
**Input:** `show(getReducings("Fe + CuSO4 -> FeSO4 + Cu"));`  
**Output:** `Reducing Agent: Fe`

## Molecular weight
Calculates molecular weight of a compound. 
**Input:** `show(getMolecWeight("H2O"));`  
**Output:** `18.015`

## Volume from mass  
Computes volume using mass and density.  
**Input:** `show(getVolume(10, 2))`  
**Output:** `5`

## Gas volume  
Calculates volume of a gas using the Ideal Gas Law. Requires `"custom"` as the second argument, followed by temperature (K) and pressure (kPa).  
**Input:** `show(getVolume(1, "custom", 273.15, 101.325))`  
**Output:** `0.221...`  

**Input:** `show(getVolume(2, "custom", 300, 100))`  
**Output:** `0.4926...`

_Note: The function returns values in liters._

## Specific volume  
Computes specific volume from total volume and mass.  
**Input:** `show(getV(22.4, 1))`  
**Output:** `22.4`

## Acid check
Returns `true` if the compound is acidic.  
**Input:** `show(isAcid("HCl"));`  
**Output:** `true`

## Base check
Returns `true` if the compound is basic.  
**Input:** `show(isBase("NaOH"));`  
**Output:** `true`

## Visualize formula
Displays a 2D and 3D graphical representation of a chemical formula or molecule.
**It's preferable to use the name of the formula e.g. "benzene" it is more accurate and gives faster results**.  
**Input:** `visualize("C6H6")`  |   `visualize("benzene")`
**Output:**
