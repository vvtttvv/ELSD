# What you need to do:

The main goal of your work is to create interpretor.
To achieve this goal, you must distribute responsibilities among yourself and set deadlines.

- My first recommendation would be to watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnBtQq6OxM) (at least the part about the interpreter) 
- Then you should write some examples and analyse parse tree in console
- Then you can code!
- Then you can connect the result with the right window (where now are tokens)
**P.S.** *If you encounter any difficulties or find any bugs, feel free to write to me or talk to me at the university.*
